Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,[1] through casual or organised participation, aim to use, 
maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for 
spectators.[2] Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous 
participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, 
simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed 
the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure 
one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an 
annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.

Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the 
largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition,[3] and other organisations such 
as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.[2] 
However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee 
(through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation 
association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi,[4][5] and limits the number of 
mind games which can be admitted as sports.
